# Practical Work Nº 2 | Video Game Programming I

## 🎮 Activity
This project is about creating a 2D platformer, implementing in code the concepts of stacks and queues learned in class.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

## 📝 Objective
Control a character that must climb platforms, avoid enemies, and reach the exit door before the time runs out.

### Main mechanics:
- 6 platforms the player can move across.
- he character can jump up through platforms from below.
- It’s only possible to go up; you can’t return to previous platforms.
- The character starts on floor 0 and must reach floor 6, where the exit door is.
- Each floor has enemies moving sideways, but only one enemy moves at a time.
- If the player touches an enemy, they fall back to the starting floor (0).

## ⏱️ Game over conditions

- **WIn:** reach the exit before the time runs out.
- **Lose:** run out of time (30 seconds) before reaching the exit.

## 📦 Implementation of Stacks & Queues

### 🔄 Queues (3 floors)

Enemies on three floors use a **queue structure**:

- The first enemy in the queue starts moving.
- When it reaches the end of the floor, it **goes off screen** and is reinserted **at the end of the queue**.
- The cycle repeats with the next enemy waiting.

👉 This simulates a **continuous and orderly flow** of enemies.

### 🔁 Stacks (3 other floors)

The other floors use a **stack structure** (Stack A and Stack B):

- The enemy at the **top of Stack A** moves across the floor.
- When it finishes its path, it’s pushed into **Stack B**.
- When all enemies are in Stack B, the process **reverses**, moving them back to Stack A.

👉 This creates a **cyclical and controlled flow** of enemies..


### Controls

- **A / D**: move
- **Space / W**: jump
- **Shift + A / Shift + D**: run

At the end, you’ll see **Game Over** or **You Win**.
